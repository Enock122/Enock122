## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Enock Kirui
I'm a rising full-stack developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences that blend technical precision and creative vision.
I specialize in modern JavaScript ecosystems, including React, HTML, and CSS, and I'm currently expanding my skill set to include TypeScript and Rust.
I transitioned to tech after graduation as a self-taught developer. My work focuses on building scalable solutions, from pixel-perfect UIs to high-performance APIs. 
Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, hiking, and exploring new technologies.
I'm open to exciting career opportunities, whether in tech or beyond, and I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge me to growâ€”let's create something extraordinary together!
